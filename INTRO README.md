Hello, my name is Alexander Lustig. I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional currently pursuing a degree in computer science at Hunter CUNY. This GitHub repository documents my journey in mastering cybersecurity, detailing both academic and extracurricular projects. The repository is structured into sections, each accessible for ease of navigation. Within each section, a README file titled by the dates I worked on that segment, containing daily progress reports. These entries not only reflect my technical growth but also my ability to handle complex cybersecurity challenges. Thank you for your interest, and I look forward to connecting with fellow professionals and potential employers.
