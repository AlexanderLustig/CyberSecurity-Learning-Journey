5/7/2024 - First day learning Python with Cisco Skills for All. Overall, I would rate it a 3 out of 10. Most of the day was spent trying to figure out GitHub and Python, downloading the necessary software, and the like. However, from what I've seen of the Cisco course so far, it seems similar to JavaScript, a language I already have experience with.

5/8/2024 - Day 2 of learning Python. I would rate it a 7 out of 10. I'm still figuring out GitHub and all its quirks. I'm noticing that this language shares many similarities with other languages, such as HTML and Java, particularly in its use of operators. Still not that hard, but I feel it will get challenging soon.
