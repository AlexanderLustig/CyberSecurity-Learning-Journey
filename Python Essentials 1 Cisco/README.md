5/7/2024 - First day learning Python with the Cisco Skills for All. Overall, I would rate it a 3 out of 10. Most of the day consisted of trying to figure GitHub and Python out, downloading the necessary stuff, and whatnot. But from what I was for into the Cisco, it looks similar to JavaScript, something I already have experience in. 

5/8/2024 - Day 2 of learning Python. I would rate it a 7 out of 10. Still figuring out Github and all of its quirks. I'm  noticing that this language has many similarities to other languages like HTML or Java with its operators

5/9/2024 - Ok, so day 3. I finished up the second module today. I struggled a bit with the final test and had to retake it three times, but finally passed with a 90%. A few of the things I got wrong were stupid mistakes, others I just didn't know the answer to. But upon seeing what the correct answer was at the end, I was able to understand why it was the right answer. 6 out of 10.
