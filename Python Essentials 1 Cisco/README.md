5/7/2024 - First day learning Python with Cisco Skills for All. Overall, I would rate it a 3 out of 10. Most of the day was spent trying to figure out GitHub and downloading Python. However, for what it's worth, the introduction to Python seemed similar to JavaScript, which I already have experience with.
